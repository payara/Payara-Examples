# Request Tracing @Traced Example
An example demonstrating a very simple use of the @Traced annotation. The @Traced annotation allows you to trace the entry and exit of CDI requests.  
The example has a servlet redirect to a second servlet, that utilises an EJB, that itself calls a RequestScoped Bean annotated with @Traced.

## Instructions
To run this example, start a Payara Server, and enable the Request Tracing service with a threshold of 3 seconds.
