# Payara Administration Samples
These samples are intended to help with server administration and may help to increase, or point you in the right direction to increase:

* Ease of use
* Speed
* Reliability
* Functionality

##### Current samples are:

* Create new domain script
* Enable hazelcast script

The current samples scripts will require you to change the `PAYARA_HOME` environment variable to the location of your Payara install as is detailed in the script comments. It is assumed `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is already set.
Both scripts are commented to explain usage and options, with links to further documentation for Payara.
